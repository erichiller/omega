# For information on configuring git, see

# This file is the effective global gitconfig
# and is specified in XDG_CONFIG_HOME
#
# The normal git global config which
# for git-for-windows is stored in
# \Git\mingw64\etc\gitconfig
# is ignored
#
# Also specified here:
# the editor is set to windows vim.exe
# NOTE: the local user ~\.gitconfig file WILL also be read
# to diagnose git config oddities use: git config --show-origin --list

########## NOTE FOR LOCAL USER ##########
# At a minimum it is recommended to include in your ~\.gitconfig
# [user]
#     # Please adapt and uncomment the following lines:
#     name = First Last
#     email =Â me@domain.tld
# [credential "https://github.com"]
#     username = myusernamehere
#
# this can also be easily performed with
# git config --edit --global
