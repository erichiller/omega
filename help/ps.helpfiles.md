### Format

Consists of a comment block **dedicated** to help-comments (no other comments in the comment block that are unrelated to the help documentation). And a series of:

```powershell
<#
.<HELP_KEYWORD>
<HELP CONTENT>
...
#>
```

### Location:
- They can be either immediately before a function.
- At the beginning of a script file 
   - preceeded only by blank lines and other comments)
   - if the next line after a script help block is a function, **there must be at least 2 blank separating lines**
